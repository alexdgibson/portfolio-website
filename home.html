                        <p class="about-content1">I'm a current Master of Philosophy student in exercise science at Queensland 
                        University of Technology. I completed my undergraduate Bachelor's degree in Biomedical 
                        Sciences and as an avid triathlete I combined my passions into exercise science research. </p>

                        <p class="about-content1">I currently have two studies completing. One involves data provided from the World Triathlon Organization 
                        with aims to advance the understanding of elite triathlon performance. The other, recruiting participants in order to
                        examining the physiological and perceptual effects of daily running and cycling training order in triathletes.</p>   
                        
                        <p class="about-content1"> While completing my current research I also works part-time at Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology on
                        a joint project with Franklin.AI. A clinically led artificial intelligence (AI) platform which 
                        is advancing and integrating the ability to diagnose cancerous pathology through digital microscopy and AI.</p> 
                        
                        <p class="about-content1"> My interest extend through exercise physiology, clinical pathology, exercise performance, 
                        biochemistry, statistics, data visualization, AI, machine learning and epidemiology.</p>
