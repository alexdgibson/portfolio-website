                <p>Over my Master of Philosophy I worked with data from The World Triathlon Organisation to further understand performance in Olympic distance triathlons. 
                    Over the 18 months I completed three study chapters of my thesis which are outlined below.

                    <h2>Olympic Distance Triathlon Through Time</h2>
                    <p>Introduction and aims: Past studies on elite Olympic distance triathlon have 
                        focused on the event's physiological and biomechanical characteristics rather 
                        than participation and demographic trends. This study aimed to describe participation, 
                        athlete demographics, and country success in elite Olympic distance triathlons 
                        from 1986 to 2022. Methods: World Triathlon Olympic distance triathlon race data 
                        (n = 97,374) were examined, with entries exceeding the world record and 
                        misidentification of races removed before analysis. Athlete participation 
                        rates were modelled using Bayesian logistic regression. Athlete age and 
                        career lengths were summarised as the median and 1st and 3rd quartile, and 
                        country success was determined by rank ordering the total wins for each 
                        country. Results: There were 3,705 races, 10,161 unique male athletes and 
                        5,139 unique females. Female participation has increased since 2003 from 28.9% 
                        to 41.9% in 2022, increasing on average 0.6849% (95% credible interval = 0.6818,
                        0.6879) each year. The median age of male athletes was 24 years (1st and 3rd 
                        quartile = 21 to 28) and females 25 years (21 to 29). The median age of male 
                        podium finishers was 26 years (1st and 3rd quartile = 22 to 28) and 26 years 
                        for women (22 to 30). The median career length was one year (1st and 3rd quartile 
                        = 1 to 3) for men and women, while 3.7% of male and 3.9% of female triathletes 
                        had careers of 10 or more years. Australian athletes had the most success with
                        361 wins, topping both men’s and women’s categories (173 male, 188 female).  
                        Conclusion: Elite female participation is increasing in Olympic distance triathlon,
                        possibly influenced by the actions of the 2002 World Triathlon’s women’s 
                        committee congress meeting. Further, understanding the reason for the success 
                        of Australian Olympic distance triathletes might be informative for optimising 
                        performance and development pathways for both sexes.
